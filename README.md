# Image/ Object Classification and Detection

## Overview
This repository contains projects that use models created from deep learning frameworks in image/object classification and detection.

## Projects
**Digit Recognition** : The dataset for the digit recognition project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data), consisting of gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine. Each image was 784 pixels (28 x 28 in dimension). A simple convoluted neural network was developed using the training set and consequently used to predict the digits in the hand-drawn images of the testing set. The neural network achieved a 98.76% accuracy in predicting the hand-drawn digits in the images of the testing dataset.
